From the data survey ”Household finance and consumption (HFCS)” conducted in 2016 by the Bank of Italy, we have aimed to proceede with our statistical investigation trying to analyse the wealth through the explaination of the ”Current price of the main residence” considering seven different regressors. The phenomena has been studied through a sample of 4176 observations. We start explaining it in relation to the behaviours of the other phenomena through the implementation of a multiple linear regression model.
